# Deals with Gold Bot
This is a bot that automatically converts MajorNelson's xbox sales into markdown tables. It also replaces the discount percentage with the discount price that links to the microsoft page for that game/add-on. These tables are then posted to r/XboxOne for the convenience of the community.

Future versions will include info from sites such as TrueAchievements, MetaCritic, and HowLongToBeat integrated into the tables for each game.

# Known Bugs
* Games/add-ons with no href display the discount percentage and do not link to anything.
