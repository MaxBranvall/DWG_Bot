^(I'm a bot serving the r/XboxOne community each week!)

^(I'm still in my very beginning stages right now. In the future I will be providing you with lots of useful info for each game such as MetaCritic scores, HowLongToBeat times, and info from TrueAchievements will all be integrated into each table for easy viewing.)

^(This will be your one stop shop for Deals with Gold, Spotlight, and Publisher sales each week!)

Disclaimer: Being a new bot I may contain a bug or two, please [notify me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=stratcat22) if you happen to catch any. Thanks so much!
